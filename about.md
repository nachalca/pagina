I am currently a PhD student in statistics at [ISU](http://www.stat.iastate.edu/). I am working under [Jarad Niemi](http://www.jarad.me/) supervision. I obtained my master degree on spring 2014, for the final project I studied the impact on posterior inference of some commonly used prior distribution for a covariance matrix, an arXived version can be found [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4050).

I was born in [Montevideo](https://www.flickr.com/groups/montevideouy/pool/page2">Montevideo), (Uruguay). Now, I am living at Ames since 2011 but I canâ€™t get used to the [snow on my garden](/images/snowtulip.jpg)
